# About
FlickTools is another ***very*** cleverly named collection of toolboxes that contain tools to make life a little easier. It is currently composed the following:

- **[FT Everyday Toolbox:](docs/ft_everyday_toolbox.md)** Your everyday toolbox. It contains tools that you might use everyday.
- **[FT Fire Toolbox:](docs/ft_everyday_toolbox.md)** Tools to make the life of a GISS mapping fire a little easier.
- **[FT Config Toolbox:](docs/ft_everyday_toolbox.md)** Don't like mucking about in JSON to set configs? Here you go.

These tools are motivated somewhat by laziness, but also by the fact that Pro doesn't always do what you want it to do.

# Usage
To use a toolbox:

1. Add a .pyt to ArcGIS Pro by navigating to one of the toolbox folders to the toolboxes directory.
2. Run a tool like any other ArcGIS Pro geoprocessing tool.
